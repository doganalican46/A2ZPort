In this project, I will demonstrate how to test our JavaScript function with various scenarios. I will explain the function and its parameter, "sentence," and then walk through different test cases. We will start with a regular usage scenario, where we test the function to find the longest word in a sentence. Next, we will explore how the function handles two words of the same length and if it chooses the correct one. Then, we will test the function with an empty input to see how it handles it. Lastly, we will examine how the function handles special characters, multiple spaces, and single-letter words. Join me as we run the project and observe the results.
